# Introduction

Matcalc allows you to perform manipulations of matrix and tabular data with a focus on utilities for the biological sciences.

# Prepare data

1. Create a table of gene sets you wish to investigate. Each column of a table/spreadsheet is a gene set where each row is a gene symbol. Gene sets can be of different lengths. The first row of each column is treated as the gene set name. If you accidently leave a gene symbol in the first row, it will be ignored.
2. Save the table as a tab delimited text file.

# Loading Data

1. Use the <strong>Open</strong> button to upload your text file of gene sets. Alternatively, drag the file onto the table and when you see the option to drop the file to open, release the mouse button and the file should load.
